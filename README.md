# Churn Prediction Model for Telecommunication Company

## Overview

Welcome to the Churn Prediction Model project! This repository contains the implementation and comparison of churn prediction models for a telecommunication company.Goal was to enhance the company's linear model used to predict customer churn. We aimed to improve predictive performance while maintaining high interpretability standards.

## Project Details

In this project, our main objectives included:

- Implementing and comparing churn prediction models to enhance customer experience and prevent potential churn.
- Emphasizing model interpretability to provide insights into churn prediction for decision-making.
- Utilizing best machine learning practices, including proper data splitting, hyperparameter tuning, and rigorous evaluation.

## Requirements

To successfully complete this project, we needed to:

- Develop and compare various churn prediction models, considering the company's requirement for high interpretability.
- Provide approaches to interpret the predictions made by our models.
- Implement a training, validation, and test split strategy and tune hyperparameters following industry standards.
- Presented our findings and approaches in a short presentation of up to 10 minutes. The presentation recording and slides were included in the submission files.
- Documented our model development, evaluation, and testing in a Jupyter notebook. Used comments and markdown cells to explain the thought process and showcased intermediate results.

## Dataset

The project dataset consisted of artificially generated data. The main dataset file was named `churn_2023.csv`.

**Dataset Property:**

- `number_customer_service_calls`: Number of recorded calls to the customer service center.
- `number_customer_service_interactions`: Number of total interactions with the customer service.
- `account_length`: Number of months since the customer account was created.
- `last_renewal`: Number of months since the last contract renewal.
- `discount`: Discount applied to customer subscription plan (in %).
- `total_usage`: Average monthly usage (in days).
- `ad_spend`: Average cost of marketing for customer acquisition and retention.
- `number_service_outage`: Total number of service outages that affected this customer.
- `service_outage_reported`: Total number of service outages that were reported.
